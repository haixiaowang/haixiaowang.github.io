Welcome to my homepage. I am Hai-xiao Wang, currently a PhD candidate advised by Professor [Ioana Dumitriu](https://math.ucsd.edu/people/profiles/ioana-dumitriu ) at [Department of Mathematics](https://math.ucsd.edu/), University of California, San Diego. Previously, I received my B.S. in [Physics](https://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/) and B.A. in [Economics](https://nsd.pku.edu.cn/) from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/)

At this moment, I am interested in random matrix theory with its applications in random graphs and hypergraphs. Feel free to contact me if any of my research interests you.
